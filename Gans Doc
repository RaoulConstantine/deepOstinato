The loss is what defines how well our model operates.
"Discriminator loss
This method quantifies how well the discriminator is able to distinguish real images from fakes.
It compares the discriminator's predictions on real images to an array of 1s,
and the discriminator's predictions on fake (generated) images to an array of 0s."

"def discriminator_loss(real_output, fake_output):
    real_loss = cross_entropy(tf.ones_like(real_output), real_output)
    fake_loss = cross_entropy(tf.zeros_like(fake_output), fake_output)
    total_loss = real_loss + fake_loss
    return total_loss"

    ones_like ---> "Creates a tensor of all ones that has the same shape as the input."
